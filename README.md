Final-year BSc Computer Science (Hons) & Mathematics student — building things at the intersection of machine learning, low-level systems, and industrial automation software.

## What I work on

I gravitate toward problems where data meets infrastructure: designing ML pipelines that actually ship, backend systems that handle real load, and integrations with hardware that doesn't speak HTTP.

Right now I'm focused on:
- ML model development, evaluation, and feature engineering
- Large dataset analysis and preprocessing pipelines
- TCP/IP-based industrial integrations (Cognex / Keyence vision systems)
- Role-based access control for machine-level authorization (RBAC)
- Automation pipelines — LeetCode → Notion syncs, data orchestration

## Technical Stack

**Languages** — Python · Rust · Java · Kotlin · SQL · C (basics)

**Backend & Systems** — FastAPI · PostgreSQL · SQLAlchemy · REST · TCP socket communication · RBAC · Industrial device protocols

**ML / Data** — Pandas · NumPy · Scikit-learn · Logistic Regression · Feature engineering · Data preprocessing pipelines

**Tools** — Git · Docker · Linux · Anaconda · Postman · Android Studio

## A bit more

I like working close to the metal — whether that's writing socket-level communication code, tuning a logistic regression model, or designing an access control system for industrial hardware. I'm drawn to systems that need to be both correct and efficient, and to the kind of engineering that doesn't have a clean tutorial to follow.

Currently open to roles and collaborations in ML engineering, backend systems, or anything sitting at an interesting intersection of the two.
